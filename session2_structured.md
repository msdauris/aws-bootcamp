## 9. EC2 Instance Management

### Launch and Configure an EC2 Instance

**Objective:** Create a web server running Apache with a "Hello World" page

#### Steps

1. **Launch Instance**
   - Navigate to EC2 → Instances → "Launch Instance"
   - Provide an instance name

2. **Configuration**
   - **AMI:** Select Amazon Linux AMI
   - **Instance Type:** Choose t2.micro (general purpose)
   - **Key Pair:** Create new keypair with default settings
     - Save to `~/.ssh/name-of-your-key.pem`
     - Store securely (cannot be re-downloaded)

3. **Network Settings**
   - Create new Security Group
   - Allow SSH & HTTP traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

4. **Storage**
   - Configure with default size

5. **Advanced Details - User Data**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Install and configure Apache web server
   yum update -y
   yum install -y httpd
   systemctl start httpd
   systemctl enable httpd
   echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
   ```

6. **Launch**
   - Click "Launch Instance"

#### Verification

- Copy the public IP address
- Open in web browser to verify Apache is serving the "Hello World" page

---

### SSH into EC2 Instance

**Objective:** Connect to EC2 instance using SSH

#### Steps

1. **Set Key Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/name-of-your-key.pem
   ```

2. **Connect via SSH**

   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/name-of-your-key.pem ec2-user@XX.XX.XX.XXX
   ```
   *(Replace XX.XX.XX.XXX with your instance's public IP)*

---

## 10. EC2 Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting Exercise 1

**Problem:** Web server not accessible via browser

#### Troubleshooting Checklist

1. **Security Group Rules**
   - Verify HTTP (TCP port 80) and SSH (TCP port 22) are open to `0.0.0.0/0`

2. **Instance Status**
   - Confirm instance is in "running" state

3. **User Data Script Verification**
   - SSH into instance and check:

     ```bash
     # Check if Apache is installed
     rpm -q httpd
     
     # Check if Apache is running
     systemctl status httpd
     
     # Start Apache if needed
     sudo systemctl start httpd
     
     # Verify index.html exists
     ls -la /var/www/html/
     ```

4. **Instance Logs**
   - Access via EC2 Dashboard → Instance → Actions → Instance Settings → Get System Log

#### Test

After completing checks, try accessing `http://your-public-ip` again.

## 11. EBS Volume Management

### Attach EBS Volume to EC2

**Objective:** Practice EBS volume attachment and configuration

#### Steps

1. **Create Volume**
   - Navigate to EC2 → Volumes → "Create Volume"
   - Configure size, type, and **availability zone** (must match EC2 instance)

2. **Attach Volume**
   - Select volume → Actions → "Attach Volume"
   - Choose target instance and device name
   - Click "Attach"

3. **Verify Attachment**
   - SSH into instance
   - Run `lsblk` to see new volume in specified device path

#### Next Steps

- **TODO:** Format and mount the disk

---

### Snapshots and Recycle Bin

**Objective:** Practice EBS backup and recovery features

#### Tasks

- **Snapshot Creation:** Create EBS snapshots for backup
- **Cross-Region Replication:** Copy snapshots to different regions  
- **Volume Restoration:** Recreate volumes from snapshots
- **Recycle Bin:** Configure retention rules for deleted resources

---

## 12. EBS Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Slow Disk Performance

**Problem:** Users experiencing slow disk performance on EC2 with attached EBS volume

#### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Instance Type Review**
   - Verify instance type meets IOPS/throughput requirements

2. **EBS Volume Type**
   - Ensure appropriate volume type for workload
   - Consider upgrading to Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Monitor CPU, memory, network usage via CloudWatch

4. **I/O Load Analysis**
   - Check if I/O exceeds volume performance limits
   - Consider workload distribution or volume upgrades

5. **Instance-Level Issues**
   - Review application configuration
   - Check for network stack bottlenecks

#### Hands-on Simulation

- Analyze CloudWatch charts showing high queue depth/throttling on gp2 volumes
- Compare EC2 instance types for IOPS-heavy workloads
- Practice switching from gp2 to io1/io2 volumes

---

### Scenario 2: Volume Detachment Failure

**Problem:** Unable to detach EBS volume from EC2 instance

#### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Instance State**
   - Ensure instance is stopped before detachment

2. **Active Processes**
   - Check for applications/services using the volume
   - Verify no open files accessing the volume

3. **Permissions**
   - Confirm IAM user/role has `ec2:DetachVolume` permission

4. **Volume State**
   - Verify volume is healthy and not in error state

5. **Retry Process**
   - Wait and retry detachment if temporary issues suspected

#### Hands-on Simulation:
- Attempt detachment while volume is in use (demonstrates failure)
- Review IAM permissions requirements
- Analyze CloudTrail logs for "unauthorizedOperation" events

---

### Scenario 3: Data Corruption

**Problem:** Data corruption observed on EBS volume with file system errors

#### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Underlying Issues**
   - Check for hardware failures or network connectivity problems

2. **File System Integrity**
   - Run consistency checks:
     - **Linux:** `fsck`
     - **Windows:** `CHKDSK`

3. **Snapshot Analysis**
   - Compare corrupted data with previous snapshots
   - Identify changes causing corruption

4. **Application Behavior**
   - Investigate application-specific corruption
   - Check for misconfigured or faulty applications

5. **Data Restoration**
   - Restore from clean backups/snapshots
   - Verify backup integrity before restoration

#### Hands-on Simulation:
- Mount broken volume and run `fsck` diagnostics
- Practice snapshot restoration procedures
- Analyze `fsck` output for error identification
