#### Groups to Analyze

**Developers Group**
- Users should have permissions to:
  - Read/write to AWS CodeCommit
  - Deploy code to Elastic Beanstalk or EC2

**QA Group**  
- Users should have permissions to:
  - Read-only access to CodeCommit
  - View logs in CloudWatch
  - Access X-Ray for troubleshooting

#### Tasks

1. **Navigate to IAM Console**
   - Go to IAM ‚Üí Groups

2. **Examine Group Policies**
   - Click on each group
   - Review attached policies
   - Note the permissions granted

3. **Check User Assignments**
   - Verify users are properly assigned to groups
   - Review individual user permissions

#### üéØ Expected Results
- **Developers:** Full deployment rights
- **QA:** Read-only + diagnostics access

---

## 3. IAM Policy Simulator

### Test User Permissions

**Objective:** Validate permissions using AWS IAM Policy Simulator

#### Access the Simulator
- Navigate to: IAM ‚Üí Policy Simulator
- Or visit: https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/

#### Test Cases

**For Developers:**
- ‚úÖ Verify they can push code to CodeCommit
- ‚úÖ Test deployment permissions to Elastic Beanstalk/EC2
- ‚úÖ Check S3 bucket access

**For QA Engineers:**
- ‚úÖ Verify read-only access to CodeCommit
- ‚úÖ Test CloudWatch logs access
- ‚úÖ Check X-Ray troubleshooting permissions
- ‚ùå Confirm they cannot push code or deploy

#### How to Use Policy Simulator

1. **Select User/Role**
   - Choose the user or role to simulate

2. **Select Service**
   - Pick AWS service (e.g., CodeCommit, S3, CloudWatch)

3. **Select Actions**
   - Choose specific actions to test

4. **Run Simulation**
   - Click "Run Simulation"
   - Review results (Allow/Deny)

---

## 4. Policy Analysis - Answer Key

### Developers Group Policies

**Attached Policies:**

- **`AWSCodeCommitReadOnly`**
  - Allows read access to CodeCommit repository
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è *Does not allow pushing code*

- **`AWSCodeDeployFullAccess`**
  - Enables code deployment using AWS CodeDeploy

- **`AmazonS3FullAccess`**
  - Read and write access to S3 buckets

- **Custom Elastic Beanstalk/EC2 Policy**
  - Create, update, and delete application resources

#### üîç Note
To allow developers to push code, attach `AWSCodeCommitPowerUser` or include `codecommit:GitPush` in a custom policy.

---

### QA Engineers Group Policies

**Attached Policies:**

- **`AWSCodeCommitReadOnly`**
  - Read access to CodeCommit repository

- **`AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`**
  - Read access to project-related S3 buckets

- **`CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess`**
  - Access logs from Amazon CloudWatch

- **`AWSXRayReadOnlyAccess`**
  - Read access for troubleshooting and performance analysis

#### üîç Note
QA engineers have read-only access to logs and tracing tools, suitable for diagnosis without impacting system state.

## 5. IAM Role Creation

### Create EC2 Service Role

**Objective:** Create IAM role for EC2 instances to access S3

#### Steps

1. **Navigate to IAM Roles**
   - Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí "Create role"

2. **Select Trusted Entity**
   - Choose **AWS Service**
   - Select **EC2** as the service

3. **Attach Policies**
   - Search and select `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`
   - This allows EC2 instances to read from S3

4. **Role Configuration**
   - **Role Name:** `EC2-S3-ReadOnly-Role`
   - **Description:** "Allows EC2 instances to read from S3 buckets"

5. **Create Role**
   - Review settings and click "Create role"

#### Usage
When launching or modifying EC2 instances, select this IAM Role to grant S3 access without embedding credentials.

## 6. Access Keys Configuration

### Create and Configure AWS CLI Access

**Objective:** Set up programmatic access for non-admin user

#### Create Access Keys

1. **Navigate to IAM Users**
   - Select a non-admin user from your groups

2. **Generate Access Keys**
   - Go to Security credentials tab
   - Click "Create access key"
   - Choose "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
   - Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Save credentials securely - secret key cannot be retrieved later

#### Configure AWS CLI

1. **Install AWS CLI** (if not already installed)

2. **Configure Credentials**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Enter Credentials**
   - Access Key ID: [Your Access Key]
   - Secret Access Key: [Your Secret Key]
   - Default region: [Your preferred region]
   - Default output format: json

#### Verify Configuration

**Test CLI Access:**
```bash
aws iam list-users
```

**Expected Result:** User should only see resources permitted by their IAM group permissions.

   - Scan QR code with app
   - Enter two consecutive MFA codes
   - Click "Assign MFA"

#### Test MFA

- Sign out and sign back in
- Verify MFA prompt appears during login
